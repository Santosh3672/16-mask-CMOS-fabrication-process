Documentation of the 16 mask CMOS fabrication process

16 mask CMOS process:
In chip fabrication we first put p substrate then put ~40nm of SiO2 above it followed by Si3N4 above it we put photoresist on top of that we put the mask with required shape. Then on applying UV rays all the regions of photoresist not covered by mask will have chemical reaction which after getting washing will be removed.The remaining area of silicon nitride is etched off and photoresist is also removed. Then the substrate is put in oxidation furnace where the Silicon oxide not covered by Silicon Nitride will grow.
